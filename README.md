Tony Khaov's dotfiles.

# Installation

1. Signin with App store GUI first!

2. Open your terminal and run this command line:

```
cd ~/Downloads/dotfiles-main && chmod u+x ./install.sh && ./install.sh
```

---

I highly recommend you to not run ./install.sh as installation is synchronous.
If you want to save time you can run shell scripts inside install.sh
individually. Make sure you complete running ./setup.sh first. For alfred and
chrome extensions, make sure
